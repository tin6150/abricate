can this file be copied?  or need to see from github and use gui to trigger some activate?
 or may need to be in main branch?

.github/workflow/docker-publish.yml  



branches
--------

tin6150-dockerizing 
	trying to have just the github workflow action (docker-publish.yml) file here, 
  + Dockerfile 
  hopefully necessary changes are in "jgrg" branch, after around git log 4c4c9fe, bca8623

jgrg
  doing the work to create db with desired sequences
  did git pull --rebase origin tin6150-dockerizing
	back around git log 0746645

tags
	git tag -a jgrg.1.1 df670cd  -m "jgrg v 0.1.1 with essentially just yfcV from NCBI" 
	git tag -a jgrg.2            -m "jgrg v 0.2   with yfcV alleles from AMNT https://bitbucket.org/genomicepidemiology/virulencefinder_db"  # tbd
  

Security settings
-----------------


the ghcr.io unathorized has to do with the
Package > Package Settings >
https://github.com/users/tin6150/packages/container/abricate/settings

needing to change the RED Danger Zone to public (it now default to private even when the repo itself is public)

so, the seq_db repo will be abandoned, at least for now (might have other use for it in future).
